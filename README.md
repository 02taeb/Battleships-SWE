# Battleships-SWE
A Swedish version of battleships done by an amateur in C#, windows console environment.

This is my first public repository.
Please be aware that I haven't got a clue how you actually use Github.
All I know is that I am using it incorrectly.
I am currently only using it as cloud storage (give me a shout if this isn't allowed) but I wanted to publicise this as it is my first major achievement (in programming).
The reason this is done in Swedish is because I need to turn it in in class (at a Swedish school).
Hopefully Google Translate will suffice if anyone should ever view the code and wonder at what they are witnessing.
